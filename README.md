## For Using
- First of all, you need to change `src/config/general.ts` to yours.
- If you want to play with color then you can take a look at `tailwind.config.ts`.
- You need to create an embedded-form on MailerLite. Then you can use the form.
- We have some images and you can change them in the `public` folder.
- Don't forget to change the footer. I put some dummy data on it.
